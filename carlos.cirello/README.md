```
$ cd $GOPATH
$ mkdir github.com/
$ mkdir github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/
$ cd github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/
$ git clone https://github.com/software-engineering-amsterdam/many-ql.git

# Documentation

## Inline documentation

Inline documentation is automatically generated by [godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc). Makefile has a target to shortcut its execution. On MacOS, it should open the browser automatically, otherwise point to the address it returns on console.

To access the inline documentation, execute:
```
$ make doc
```

# Development Cycle

## Tests

Ideally, all relevant code should be tested. This project uses the native test system of Go.

If you want to run tests only:
```
$ make test
```
