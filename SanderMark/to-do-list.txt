Belangrijk
- Display Warnings(!)
- Polymorphism in GUI
- Catch parse errors

Minder belangrijk
- Split context?
- Escape input?
- Check erroneous input in gui?
- Resizing window?

- else statements voor andere types / values etc. (errors)
- curly altijd, dus geen 1 line ifs etc.
- Rule 4: First class collections (seperate collections from classes)
- one dot per line. (see paper for example)
- Within classes dont repeat the name of the class within methods like shipOrder, just call it order()
- classes of 50 > is a issue


- You can often use Inline Temp (121) to get rid of the temps. Long lists of parameters can be slimmed
down with Introduce Parameter Object (247) and Preserve Whole Object (241)

- Conditionals and loops also give signs for extractions. Use Decompose Conditional (136) to deal with conditional expressions. 
With loops extract the loop and the code within the loop into its own method.

- Large classes (to many instance variables), divide them into different components(classes)
